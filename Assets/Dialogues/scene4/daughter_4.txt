You: Your majesty, may I help you ? You seem worried.
Queen: Please don’t call me that. You are still my father even if I am a queen now.
You: Alright, my dear. How is my grandson ?
Queen: This is why I need to see you
You: Huh?
Queen: A suspicious elf showed up last night and told me that you made a commitment with him that I had to give my boy to him.
You: He finally came after years.
Queen: Father, I can’t give my boy to him.
You: Don’t worry my girl. I will talk to him.
