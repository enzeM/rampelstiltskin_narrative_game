Elf: You thief ! You think I am not aware of what you done ? You have to pay for this. Give me the boy!
You: Mr Elf, please let my boy go! You can take my life.
Elf: You are nothing to me. Fine! This is your last chance! Guess my name within three days. I will take your boys by all means if you canâ€™t tell me my true name.
You: OK, I promise you.
Voice in mind: I have to ask someone for help!
